Memory seemed to have failed my friends; they have forgotten the road that leads to my door.  

Technology seemed to have failed my friends; they are unable to use Google Maps to find the way to my home.

Education seemed to have failed my friends; they are unable to read the messages I sent and write back their replies to me.  

I seemed to have failed my friends; they all are great human beings, and surely all inadequacies and blames lie with me fairly and squarely.   

> In my life  
Oh, why do I give valuable time  
To people who don't care if I live or die?

~ Steven Patrick Morrissey, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now
