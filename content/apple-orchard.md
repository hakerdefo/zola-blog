I'm walking with my hands raised and there is a countdown going in my head;  
15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 09, 08, 07, 06, 05, 04, 03, 02; in a flashing move my right hand reaches the belt and presses the button.

I first sat my foot on the little village of Aru about 10 days ago. I was just another backpacker trying to escape the ghosts of the past and find some meaning out of this quagmire called life. And Himalayas were an obvious choice for me but what brought me to this little hamlet surrounded by lakes, meadows and mountains is unclear and what drove me towards the home-stay run by Tarik is even more vague. Tarik, a tall & lanky guy in his late twenties with eyes sparkling with life and a bright, almost perpetual smile that never seemed to leave his face even for a single moment. We hit it off almost immediately. My cynicism and his optimism quickly became a glue of sort for our friendship. On the very first evening he brought a full plate of dinner and when I informed him that I'm barely managing to pay for the duration of my stay and that I certainly won't be able to afford the luxury of a full meal and that biscuits and water would do fine for me, his smile didn't fade but hurt was apparent in his voice when he replied to me that a brother wouldn't even dream of charging a brother for a thing called food and if I was to decline this food, he would go voluntarily hungry. We ate together that evening and every evening or afternoon after that. He had already become a friend but soon he became my philosopher and guide too. After learning about my losses, sorrows, trials, tribulations; he and his optimism would try to conquer my fears and cynicism as we would talk and talk and talk around the glow and warmth of the slowly fading fire late into the night, every night. During daytime he would become my guide as we would go hiking and trekking in those meadows and mountains. There was hardly a trail there that we didn't walk nor was there a single lake in whose freezing waters we didn't swim. I learned a lot about nature from him. I also learned a lot about life from him. His parents got killed in an exchange between militants and security forces when he was in his teens. He was madly in love with a girl from a nearby town and his dream was to buy an apple orchard, marry his sweetheart and live happily ever-after. He was optimistic that things would improve security wise and resulting tourist rush would allow him to earn and save enough money to fulfill that dream. It was on an afternoon of my penultimate day in Aru that an idea came to me. More I thought about it, more attractive it became. I wanted to do something for him. I knew that there was a zero chance for him to earn enough money from this little home-stay to buy an apple orchard. I knew that he was headed towards a certain dream break and a likely heart break and I didn't want that to happen. I had a plan.  

His first and immediate reaction after hearing my plan was that I was crazy and it was a stupid and a dangerous thing and he wasn't going to be part of it. What was my plan? I wanted to fake our kidnapping. Militants would kidnap us while we were hiking in the mountains and would ask 2.5 million from the authorities in exchange of our safe release. They would ask them to pay the amount in Bitcoins. He didn't have a clue what a Bitcoin was and how it worked and he didn't want to know as he didn't want to have anything to do with this plan of mine. I had to do something dramatic to convince him. And it took a handful of tears with a fabricated story about some imaginary bad loan sharks and how they would seize my house if I failed to pay them the due amount finally persuaded him to join this crazy plan. I already had a place in my mind where we would hide during this fake kidnap. It was a small wooden hut on the slope of this big mountain and it was surrounded on all sides by a dense cedar forest. He had told me earlier that it was rumored to be a hiding place of militants. I created a Bitcoin address for this purpose, collected phone numbers of local TV channels and newspapers and everything was in place to set the wheels in motion.  

We started early in the morning the next day and reached a spot that was in a completely opposite direction and about 20 kilometers away from our would be hiding place. I already had the ransom message ready as a draft and I had it scheduled to be delivered to the local TV stations and newspapers at 18:00 that evening. I selected a cedar tree with a thick underbrush around its trunk and placed my cellphone in a way that it would stay relatively invisible but didn't look deliberately hidden at the same time. In the ransom message I had given four days of time limit to the authorities. Once I was satisfied with my placement of the phone we were on our way again. We circled back and skirted the village and reached the hiding place about 18:30 in the evening. We had enough food and water with us to last us for a full week and there wasn't much to do now but lie low and wait. Locals were right. Those rumors were right. That hut was definitely a militant hideout. There were boxes scattered all over the floor and every single one of them was completely full. There were guns, grenades, IEDs, suicide belts and a few other things. He nearly fainted a few times as I opened one box after another and it took a great effort in calming him down and making him understand that we were past the return point by that time and there was no way out of this plan now. All we could and would have to do is wait and wait.  

We would only venture out of the hut either during early in the morning or after the sunset and only for a brief period of time. Of-course we were worried and it was very hard to stay put in that small place, surrounded by arms and ammunition and stay calm. I kept telling him and myself that it just was a matter of a couple of days and everything would be fine after that. It was clearly visible that he was very nervous and near breaking point all the time but he not even once blamed me, confronted me or cursed me for putting him in that situation. There was no way of knowing what was happening in the outside world. Did the media get that message? Did they forward that to authorities? Did authorities buy the story? Were they paying the ransom? Where were they searching? What was on their mind? This lack of information and resulting suspense were the hardest things to take. We both found it near impossible to go to sleep. We had a plenty of food but it seemed our appetite had deserted us. It was becoming very very hard to bear the whole situation so I decided that we would wait till tomorrow afternoon and if nothing happens by then we would go back to the village and would tell everybody that militant decided to let us go for reasons not known to us. I informed of this and for the first time in two days a hint of a smile crossed his tired face. I came up with the descriptions of two militants and made him go over them multiple times until I become sure that our versions of story wouldn't mismatch. It was our third night in that hut and may be it was fatigue or may be it was the knowledge that tomorrow would be our last day here that made us fall sleep for the very first time.  

Firecrackers! Noise of firecrackers! I slowly opened my eyes, yawning and cursing the bastard that decided to burst firecrackers at this time of the night. But then I saw his face; it had turned ghostly pale. He was shivering and was scared to death. What? I asked him. Security forces are here was his mumbled reply and then he started crying. I was surprisingly calm but I was completely confused. I heard the firecrackers bursting again but this time I knew that they weren't firecrackers, they were warning shots fired in the air. Then a voice amplified via a megaphone came bursting through the silent night, came bursting through the wooden walls, informing Tarik the militant that he had been surrounded on all sides by the troops and there was no way out for him but to let go the tourist and surrender. I didn't believe what my own ears just heard! Momentarily my body and brain became numb! I looked momentarily into Tarik's eyes and my brain went numb again. They had concluded that he was a militant and nothing on this earth would now be able to prove his innocence and my guilt. He was a Kashmiri. A Kashmiri is always a militant; Indian military doctrine of the past 30 years. No truth, no lies would convince them of his innocence. Even god would fail in proving this innocent man's innocence. Most probably he knew this too. I went to a box, opened it and took out a couple of suicide belts. I wore one and pulled my sweater over it, handed the other belt to him and told him that these were two way communication devices and we were going to use them to our advantage. I took his hands into mine, embraced him and told him that everything was going to be alright and there was no need to worry. I had one last plan that will free us both. And then I told him my plan. I would open the door, step outside with my hands raised, would slowly walk towards the security guys and approximately after 15 seconds I would be standing face to face with them and would explain everything to them, I would have them talk with him via the communication device I was wearing; all he had to do was press the button on his belt after 15 seconds of my stepping out of this hut. Was he ready? He nodded. I shook his hands, hugged him, opened the door and stepped outside.
