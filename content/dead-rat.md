I’m lying on the ground like a dead rat on the corner of the street. No one even bothers to take a look cause there are so many of them, dead rats.  
<!-- more -->
I'm like that sunshine on a rainy day which only lasts for a moment or two And then disappears again behind the gloom. I'm just another gloomy Sunday evening with cloudy weather but no sign of rain.  

And then I see you. You make me human, you make me feel, you make me feel jealous about the love that I don't deserve.  

I want to know where are you going, I want to know what do you think when you are all alone by yourself. Do you think of me?  

Do you like it when I pass by your house without any purpose?  

Your pretty face seem to be smiling every time you see me cry. Or is it just another mysterious way of saying that you love me?  

Oh, how I wish I could break your heart! I want to leave you, but I also want to see you die slowly, each & every day! I really do!  

Oh, how I wish I could comb your long raven black hair all day and all night long!  

Why don't you rip me off, tear me apart and eat me inside out? Do it, babe, because you want it.  

Oh, you beautiful creature with a blood stained knife in your hand, please show no mercy on my body and soul! Oh, you beautiful creature!  

Then please leave me crying on the floor! Please leave me dying on the floor! And please don’t look back!  

How I wish I can tell you just how much I love your hate and disgust! Oh, please don't look back!  

And sometimes I wish if only I could be someone else, some other person, someone very different, almost a total stranger! Who knows, you might love me then?
