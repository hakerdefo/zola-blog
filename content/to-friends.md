Talk comes for free cause talk is dirt cheap  
It flies with the wind and it's hard to keep  
But for some funny reasons it's my only wish  
<!-- more -->
All I really need is a wee little talk  
All night I pray for a wee little talk  
All I really want is a wee little talk  

Call me if you can or may be leave some text  
Come by to my home you can come with the pet  
I won't shed the tears and you won't get wet  

All I really need is a wee little chat  
All night I pray for a wee little chat  
All I really want is a wee little chat  

Talk about your kids & we'll talk about wife  
Talk about your dogs & we'll talk about life  
Any crap is good as it might help me survive  

All I really need is a wee little crap  
All night I pray for a wee little crap  
All I really want is a wee little crap  

Talk comes for free cause talk is dirt cheap  
It flies with the wind and it's hard to keep  
But for some funny reasons it's my only wish  

All I really need is a wee little talk  
All night I pray for a wee little chat  
All I really want is a wee little crap
