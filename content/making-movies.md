Me and my ma are watching a movie in a cinema hall.  
What movie are we watching here?  
What cinema hall is this?  
I don't know.  
<p></p>

*Are you comfortable ma?*  
*Yes dear.*  
<p></p>

On the big cinema screen, I can see myself with a bunch of unknown and shady looking guys. A big stash of cash and empty bottles of whiskey are lying around on the floor. Suddenly the door bursts open and we are surrounded by a bunch of guys flashing their guns at us. The scene ends abruptly and we all are sitting around a campfire, chatting & laughing and getting drunk. Someone is helping some guy in shooting heroin. The sun is slowly setting across an empty & arid desert plain.

Me and my ma are going back home on my scooter.  
What road is this?  
What place does it lead to?  
I don't know.

*Are you comfortable ma?*  
*Yes dear.*

In a crowded restaurant, I can see myself having dinner with a friend of mine. He seems a bit drunk already but we still order a bottle and start drinking. My friend is really sad and is on the verge of crying. He is speaking something but I'm unable to hear a single word he is saying for some reason. Our empty bottle is quickly replaced with a full one by an eternally smiling yet shy looking waitress. The music played by a live band slowly starts fading away into the silence.

My friend crashes onto a sofa, I can see his little daughter playing on the kitchen floor. Her toys seem eerily real. The knife in her hand seems almost real. I go upstairs and meet my friend's mother. She is crying and pleads to me to help my friend get out of his alcohol addiction. I say something incoherent and leave the room. I'm carrying my friend's baby in my arms and I'm finding her facial expression a bit odd. The cold edge of the knife is slowly sinking into my back.

Me and my ma are flying towards the sun.  
What, why, how. They don't matter.  
What matters is this moment.  
I do know now.  
<p></p>

*Are you comfortable son?*  
*Yes dear.*
