You've lost weight, I hear them say  
Then why I feel really heavy inside  
It is confusing, sure I gotta weigh  
<!-- more -->
We're fed up is their one complaint  
I will let this quietly grow inside  
They will never get to see the pain  

You've gotta move on with the clock  
Even with the dead batteries inside  
What they mean is learn zombie walk  

I think my friends are really great  
They might worry for me deep inside  
Pretense at times is your best mate
